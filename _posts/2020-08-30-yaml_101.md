## Introduction

YAML is short for "YAML Ain't Markup Language", it's a way of storing basic data structures in human
readable form. You may also have heard about JSON, XML, TOML formats which are also used for this purpose.
It's worth mentioning that YAML is a superset  of JSON, meaning any valid JSON file is also a valid YAML
file. The aim of this blog post is to introduce you to a new format and show a few trick if you knew it
already

YAML 1.2 specification mentions a few goals
1. YAML is easily readable by humans.
1. YAML data is portable between programming languages.
1. YAML matches the native data structures of agile languages.
1. YAML has a consistent model to support generic tools.
1. YAML supports one-pass processing.
1. YAML is expressive and extensible.
1. YAML is easy to implement and use

## Basic Syntax

The main reason behind YAML is data structure representation. There are basically 3 structures sequence,
map(mapping) and variable, actual document itself is just a big map. As I mentioned previously valid
JSON is a valid YAML, but YAML can do much more with much less characters. First of all, identifiers for
structures don't have to be enclosed in double quotes. Brackets can also be skipped, instead of special
formatting of the file is used. An identifier ends with ":" and non zero number of whitespace characters
after witch formatting determines the structure. If value is in the same line structure created is
variable. If after ":" newline character is present and some following lines have variables defined in
them with the same level of indentation but higher than "parent" identifier, this construct is a mapping.
If next lines start with "-" then a sequence was created.

```yaml
string: value
integer: 1
float: 1.1
dictionary:
  key1: value1
  key2: value2
array:
- one
- two
- tree
```

Great thing about each one of them is the fact that nesting is allowed.
Do you want array of maps of maps? Piece of cake, just take look.

```yaml
array:
- mapZero:
    key0: 
      subkey0: s0
      subkey1: s1
- mapOne:
    key0: 
      subkey0: s0
      subkey1: s1

```
You can create a sequence and a map inline using syntax similar to JSON. This syntax also allows creation
of documents independent from formatting, albeit it's less clear this way.

```yaml
array: [ mapZero: {key0: {subkey0: s0, subkey1: s1}}, mapOne:  {key0: {subkey0: s0, subkey1: s1}}
]
```
Latter 2 snippets of yaml are interchangeable.

## Advanced Syntax

YAML, when looked in depth, is much more complex that any one might have anticipated after first contact.
This section is a breve overview of some less popular but useful features.

### Multiline Strings

As YAML is supposed to be "easily readable by humans" and sometimes long strings of characters are
required to be under certain identifier. Let's say we want to put 256 characters under key "long_string".
We can put them in one line

```yaml
long_string: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer ac elit mi. Vestibulum sem orci, placerat sed condimentum id, rutrum imperdiet dolor. Vestibulum ante ipsum primis in faucibus orci luctus et ultrices posuere cubilia curae; Curabitur nullam.
```

It's readable to the certain degree but we can do better. For example add double quotes
```yaml
long_string: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
Integer ac elit mi. Vestibulum sem orci, placerat sed condimentum id,
rutrum imperdiet dolor. Vestibulum ante ipsum primis in faucibus orci
luctus et ultrices posuere cubilia curae; Curabitur nullam."
```

Yaml has multiple versions of multiline strings, depending on character after the identifier. String
starts form the following line, it has to have increased level of indentation. You could also explicitly
state number of whitespace characters before each line begins. If unspecified defaults to number of
whitespace characters before first line in string. Multiple variation go like this:

```yaml
zero: |2
   This text is interpreted literally
   notice this was indented with 3 spaces with string starting at 2
one: |
  This text is interpreted literally
  new lines are preserved
two: >
  This text is folded
  newline characters are replaced with spaces
  
  blank lines are replaced with newline characters
tree: |-
  In this case trailing newline is removed
four: |+
  Now any trailing newline character is preserved


# Like ones above
```

When using PyYaml a dictionary was loaded. After using pretty printing pprint module, this is what I got:
```python
{   'four': 'Now any trailing newline character is preserved\n\n\n',
    'one': 'This text is interpreted literally\nnew lines are preserved\n',
    'tree': 'In this case trailing newline is removed',
    'two': 'This text is folded newline characters are replaced with spaces\n'
           'blank lines are replaced with newline characters\n',
    'zero': ' This text is interpreted literally\n'
            ' notice this was indented with 3 spaces with string starting at '
            '2\n'}
```
Remember that by definition maps are unordered so your mileage may vary. In python it's a bit more
complex (check bibliography for Python's dictionary)

### Variable interpretation

Variables in yaml can be mapped (:wink:) to different types, like floats, ints etc. We can also make YAML
parser do some conversion between different representation of a number. It's a nice little feature
allowing for easier variable definition for example:

```yaml
sequence:
  - 0xFFFFFF
  - 0xFF0000
  - 0xFFFFFF
```

turns into:

```python
{'sequence': [16777215, 16711680, 16777215]}
```

Some other formats for numbers are listed below:

```yaml
sequence:
- 010 #integer interpreted as Base8
- 0x10 #integer interpreted as hexadecimal
- 10  #integer 
- 10.2 # floating point
- 10.2.1 # string
```

Using PyYaml this is what was loaded:
```python
{'sequence': [8, 16, 10, 10.2, '10.2.1']}
```

### Multiple documents in one file

```yaml
#document zero
document_number: 0
just_array:
- one:
    q: 1
- two:
    w: 2
---
---
#document one
document_number: 1
strange_dictionary:
  k:
  - j
  - m
```

### Anchors


You may have heard about **DRY** principle that is "Don't Repeat Yourself". Yaml has a convenient feature
that allows applying this principle namely anchors, aliases. Anchors behave like variables inside the
document itself. An anchor is creates using "&anchor_name" syntax. It's value can be later referenced
using "*anchor_name" syntax.

```yaml
variable: &reference value
different_variable: *reference 
```
turns into
```python
{'variable': 'value', 'different_variable': 'value'}
```

This is already cool but I m not done yet. In case of more complex structures, like maps and sequences,
you can actually merge structures together and not override them.  In this case special syntax
"<< : *anchor_name" is used. It's worth mentioning it was added in YAML 1.1

```yaml
younger_sister: &one
 first name: Serena 
 last name: Williams
older_sister:
 << : *one
 first name: Venus
```
After parsing it will look like
```python
{   'older_sister': {'first name': 'Venus', 'last name': 'Williams'},
    'younger_sister': {'first name': 'Serena', 'last name': 'Williams'}
}
```
Actually you could specify sequence of references after "<< :" operator, but inline sequence must be used
([ item0, item1]). The next one will overrider the previous one. Theoretically after merging operator
inline dictionary can be specified like ( { q: 0, w: 1} ). As far I know inline dictionary and sequence aren't 
actual terms in case of YAML, but I hope you get it.
